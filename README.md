# Becoming-Great-in-Development

  **Why languages?**
1-->Languages are used to write application
2-->Developers write high level code in these languages
3-->Every language has a compiler which converts the developer code into 01

  **Interpreted vs compiled languages**
_Compiled languages:->_
1. First need to compile, then need to run 
2. Usually donâ€™t compile if there is 
an error in the code 
3. Example - C++, Java, Rust, Golang
   
 _Interpreted Languages:->_
1. Usually go line by line 
2. Can run partially if the error comes later 
3. Example - Javascript, Python

  **Single threaded nature of JS**
JS can only use one of these at a time 
It is single threaded
This is why it is considered to be a bad language for 
scalable systems 
There is a way to make it use all cores of your machine


  **Simple primitives**
Variables (let, var, const) 
Data types - strings, numbers and booleans 
If/else 
Loops - For loop
  **Complex primitives**
1. Arrays 
2. Objects

  **Functions**
Functions let you 
1. Abstract out logic in your program 
2. Take arguments as an input 
3. Return a value as an output 
4. You can think of them as an independent program that is supposed to do something 
 given an input 
5. Functions CAN take other functions as input - this will confuse you (callbacks)

  **Synchronous**
All code runs line by line

  **Asynchronous**
Asynchronous functions in programming are those 
that allow a program to start a potentially long running operation and continue executing other 
tasks without waiting for that operation to 
complete. This is particularly important in 
environments like web browsers or Node.js, where 
waiting for an operation to finish (like fetchin
data from a server or reading a large file) coul
make the application unresponsive.
